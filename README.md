# Hello my name is Hugo Meira
I'm a junior programmer

I started programming last year and currently i only know HTML and CSS.
Now im currently unable to use a pc so that really slow down me because making a website using only a phone and not knowing how it behaves in other dimensions and resolutions its hard.

- Java

- C#
- Typescript
- Kotlin
- Dart
- Go
